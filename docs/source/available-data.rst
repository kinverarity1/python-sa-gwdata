Available data
========================

Water monitoring data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Water well monitoring data is available through Groundwater Data:

- **Groundwater level**: manual measurements made every month or perhaps
  quarterly or annually.
- **Salinity samples**: water samples collected from wells, usually by pumping
  deliberately for monitoring (or sampled from an irrigation pump), and
  the salinity estimated by measuring the electrical conductivity (EC)

Lithological and stratigraphic data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Driller's logs**: submitted by drillers at the time a well was drilled
- **Lithological logs**: submitted often at time of drilling by a geologist
- **Stratigraphic logs**: maintained by Department for Environment and Water
  (DEW) and Department for Energy and Mining (DEM)
- **Hydrostratigraphic logs**: maintained by DEW

Well construction data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Drilled intervals**: submitted by the driller at time of drillhole
  construction
- **Casing**: contains details of the casing installed in a well - includes
  some limited information about the annular grout. Note that production
  zone data is not stored alongside casing data
- **Production zones**: details of the production zone interval of a well e.g.
  screens, slotted sections, blank sections in screens, open hole intervals, and
  riser pipes.
- **Water cut**: observations of groundwater level, salinity and yield made
  at the time of drilling; generally historical and collected during cable
  tool drilling.
- **Elevation**: generally water monitoring wells are surveyed specifically
  for their elevation, and the data are kept here. The data are also arranged
  by time such that changes in the reference point for groundwater level
  measurements can be fully corrected to have a consistent and accurate
  measurement of groundwater level over the well's life.

Other data - less frequently collected
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Water chemistry**: we also store water chemistry
  data for a variety of wells
